# my-projects
Hi All, this is the repo where I did my DevOps internship projects. I have updated my coding for each and every project. #happy learnings...
Here are my tasks
	a. Create a bash script that monitors the CPU usage of the server, and configure Slack Alert. If CPU utilization exceeds the threshold value, send a notification to Slack.
	b. Write a bash script that automates the process of creating backups for specified files and directories. Backups should happen on a daily basis.
	c. Write a bash script to install node_exporter and show the status.
	d. Write a bash script to Delete temporary files or logs older than a certain date to free up disc space by removing unnecessary files.
	e. Write a bash to ping a list of hosts and report their status.
